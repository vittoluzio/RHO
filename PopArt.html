        				Another one of Warhol’s pieces, “Marilyn Diptych” creates irony from the portrait of Marilyn Monroe. Brightly colored and saturated copies of Marilyn span the left side of the painting in a neat 5x5 table. Contrasted on the right side of the divide is a similar copy of a black and white copy of the left side. While they are all copies of the same portrait, they have different contrasts. Even the left side that contains more similarly colored portraits, they still have slight differences in the amount of shadow and contrast on the face of Marilyn. On the right side there are more clear differences, such as the dark and distorted second column while the fourth and fifth column are almost completely white. 
						The left side celebrates the cult status and celebrity personality of Marylyn Monroe, discolored with pink skin, blond hair, and a blue and orange background. This represents her glitzy lifestyle as a celebrity, while the right side contemplates the star’s mortality. The dichotomy between the fun and desolate nature of Marilyn is striking, and makes one question their conceptions about celebrity life. The repetition takes personality out of her face, and makes her face seem almost like a mask. She is represented as an entity and no longer a person, which is contrary to the ultimate goal of a portrait. It mimics the side by side format of older Christian art, once again reappropriating existing forms to create new meaning. This questionment of idolization and reappropriation of pop culture and repetition of the new printing technique shows the postmodern thinking pushing the pop art movement.

						Perhaps the most famous pop artist, Andy Warhol created a satirical painting of Mao Zhedong. Warhol repurposed an image that Mao Zhedong used as totalitarian propaganda during his dictatorship in China. Warhol mocks his authoritarian portrait by adding splashes of color, giving the harsh dictator makeup and eyeliner. It looks like a graffiti rendition of Mao, being mocked by freedom of speech. The background is blue, creating a benevolent sense around the fascist leader. This irony is what propels pop art, recreating these popular images into something greater by adding details to them. The contrast between a man responsible for the death of millions and the flamboyant makeup is jarring in a comical way. This dark comedy points to nihilism and the ability to make light of some of the worst world events, another point of pop art. These political musings and provocation does make fun of the totalitarian, but it is still devoid of a real narrative, simply casting an ironic filter over the darkness caused by this propagandist portrait used to manipulate the masses. The silkscreen technique was employed to create the prints used to create multiple versions and variations of this Mao. This also sees bridging between popular iconography with high art while questioning what is considered art.

						A contemporary of Basquiat in the graffiti art scene, Keith offers a different perspective with his mural “Crack is Wack”. While Basquiat was aggressive and instinctual, Keith Haring offers a more polished and cartoon based compositions. The piece is a bright orange and red backdrop over black lines and writing. The caption reads, “CRACK IS WACK” right above the middle of the mural and “NYC 1986” in the corner. There is a scene of chaos and anarchy depicted in the bottom, with the skull grabbing the viewer’s initial attention after the caption. The attention is brought to the crack piece and burning $0 dollar bill through the sea of wrestling cartoon people. However, these depictions are drawn in rounded and almost non threatening. There is no real sense of danger from the mural, despite the heavy imagery, red and black colors, and anti drug message. 
						The heavy use of lines is a distinctive feature of Haring’s art. The little lines around the skull and people denote a type of movement and surprise of the crack addicted skull. The two dimensionality of the piece is interesting to note, although there is some sense of dimensionality by the people being in front of each other while wrestling, each figure is 2D in nature. For this reason his style is instantly recognizable despite the supposed easy-to-draw style. The social commentary is seemed to be almost self deprecating, creating a meta and self aware message about the ineffectiveness of the war on drugs while recognizing the damage that drugs and addiction can have on society. This style brings on elements of pop art, a direct answer to abstract expressionists with direct allusions and appearances of pop culture. This can be seen in the blurring of “high” art and “low” art by Haring’s style.
