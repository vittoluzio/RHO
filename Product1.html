        					Jackson Pollock created a sense of mastery over chaos with his famous pour and drip techniques. Despite the lack of a true form, the combination of abstract black, white, brown, and turquoise lines combine to create a certain tone that denotes meaning. This type of style is known as “Abstract Expressionism”. Emotional understanding of the piece is given partially through the context of the artist’s methodology, but is mainly derived from the gestural improvisation of the colors and shapes given by Pollock onto the canvas. This level of abstraction is devoid of any type of representation, thus creating another way of rejecting a metanarrative, rather focusing on the emotions evoked from such a painting. This is where Pollock derives his postmodernism from.
							The black, white, brown and turquoise lines mix and match, creating dichotomies and likeness between thickness, direction, curve, straightness, overlapping over each other creating a sense of interconnectedness. This overlapping of paint also creates a complex textural element to the painting, not noticeable upon first glance, adding another layer of complexity over the painting. The brown nature and horizontal composition of the colors also does evoke a sense of nature despite Pollock’s non-representational style, creating a painting that makes one reminisce of the Autumn Rhythm.

						Similar to the previous painting, Jackson Pollock’s abstract expressionism is in full display in this vibrant composition. The dripping and pouring on this canvas are much more aggressive and colorful in this collage of splattered paint. The painting produces an assault of the eye, for all of the formless colors contort and shift as the viewer attempts to hold on to a sense of narrative or symbolism that is simply nonexistent. The white almost seems to imitate writing, only to be lost in formlessness among the other colors. Once again the different colored improvised strokes contort and conform with each other with their varying size, curvature, style, length and width. It is important to note the grand size of the piece, which only adds to the intensity of the composition.
						This was painted when there were high tensions between the United States and the Soviety Union. Many interpreted this as an expression and convergence of free speech. Pollock’s lack of conventions and genre rule breaking were a symbol of the free fighting against oppression and communism; the painting can be seen as a ballad of individuality. While this is a narrative, contradictory to the rejection of metanarratives of postmodernism, it was created by a lack of conformity and storytelling. The lack of narrative itself became one, the lack of conformity becomes the central theme and a symbol for freedom.
