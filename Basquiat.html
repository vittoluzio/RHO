        				Jean-Michel Basquiat’s works are a great example of neo-expressionism, responding to minimalism with his abstract figures drawn in a rough and emotional way. Two figures contrast over a black background with bright colors of red, pink, yellow, orange and blue. Both faces appear like masks, and the red figure appears to be smiling and gesturing to his peer. There is a Pollock-esque technique of splatter and pouring on the figures that creates a sense of movement and urgency. The colors and almost cartoonish and saturated appearance of the painting leads to a youthful tone to the piece; it points to a freedom of spirit that Basquiat painted with.
                        The piece is named dustheads, leading to the interpretation that these figures are on the influence of PCP. This explains the aggression and fantastical representation of people in this painting. The value of this piece is tied to the freedom and expressiveness of Basuiat, much like the appeal of Pollock. The joy and reality is seen through the emotional lense rather than an analytical one. There is a sense of primitivism and rawness through not only the composition but even the use of spraypaint and the quickness at which Basquiat worked to create postmodern visual vignettes.

						As Basquiat’s most expensive painting ever sold, one expects the intensity and rawness that this piece evokes. The saturated blue background is secondary to the agressively drawn abstract head with black, red, orange and white all overlayed on top of each other. There is a white/gray plane on the right of the painting, alongside indecipherable writings and asymmetrical patterns, showing how the painting had been painted, edited and painted over while still maintaining a raw feeling. This overlap of paint is representative of a chaotic thought process, with ideas stumbling half-completed over each other, while still maintaining a basic figure of the ego. There are splashes of color around it, non repeating and random, adding to the personal and emotional expression by Basquiat. 
                        The painting is reminiscent of graffiti found in the subway, a gritty and unsanitary tone brought by the materials and urban style. Basquiat is direct with the viewer, expressing a side of humanity that is almost animal-like under the intense gaze of the white eyes of a crazed man. Dripping of paint is used once again to create a visceral sensation, adding to the energy of the piece. This all culminates in a portrait painting that is questioning the idea of what it means to be human through energy given through by artist’s rawness and postmodernism.

						The Irony of a Negro Policeman depicts a politically motivated but jarring composition. The white background contrasts with the blackand blue figure of the policeman. Red, white, yellow, and orange are used to highlight and create small details throughout the painting. The scribbles throughout almost appear to be made by a child, showing the quickness in which Basquiat creates his paintings. The near improvisation adds to the rawness of the piece, with small writings are incomplete, not finished and spelled incorrectly. The large red hat sits atop the policeman’s skull-like and primitive head, depicting a sense of lunacy and delusion.
	                    Basquiat critiques black men who have decided to help white people maintain control and continue to marginalize their own people. The word “PAWN” is attempted to be written twice, showing how these black policemen have been brainwashed into this corrupt system. It is ironic how they continue to further white control while putting down their own people and subculture in America, essentially enslaving themselves. The totalitarian black figure is in control, but is unaware of its own impact on his community. The scratching out and scribbles depict the post-colonial expression in a way that shows his self awareness of process and artistic intent, a postmodern concept despite the antiwhite and police narratives.
